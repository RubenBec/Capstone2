Proposal 1:
Can I find keywords in reddit posts to make a model to predict the success of it?

Proposal 2:
I talk about politics a lot with my friends and family. One of my really good friends is from a rural area and we often have differing views about a lot of things. We have chalked it up to rual vs urban. In the national landscape there is a similar ideological divide. I started thinking, is there a certain feature that can help me predicit how an area will vote. Can I make a model that will predict if a county will vote democratic or republican based on population, population density, median income, and other features. It will be hard to find the data but I think this will be really fun.
